THE BIG TODOS:
 - UI System - crosshair, block selector, and block outline

 FRESH - MAKE A STUPID UI SYSTEM.
 SELECTING BLOCKS SUCKS!

 - Skybox renderer - sun and stars (with fake sunset)
 - Player Physics
 - More blocks
 - Renderer with AO, Deferred rendering, specular (from texture atlas), normal mapping, bloom and HDR, maybe PBR?
 - Multisampling and Sample Rate Shading to improve textures significantly from afar
 - Shadow mapping
 - Lights - use descriptor arrays / storage buffers
 - Custom allocator for chunks (both DRAM and VRAM)
 - Biomes - either perlin or worley noise (maybe integrate structures into biome generation?)
 - Seperate water shader
 - Fake water physics?
 - Better structure generation
 - World Save System
 - Sprites like flowers
 - Animated textures like water
 - Slabs and Stairs - correct meshing
 - Particle System
 - Entity System?
 - Code for things like doors and chests that update every frame

 And finally,
 MORE GAMEPLAY!
