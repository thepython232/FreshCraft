THE BIG TODOS:
 - Sort transparent blocks
 - UI System - crosshair, block selector, and block outline
 - Skybox renderer - sun and stars
 - Player Physics
 - More blocks
 - Renderer with AO, Deferred rendering, specular (from texture atlas), normal mapping, bloom and HDR
 - Shadow mapping
 - Lights - use descriptor arrays / storage buffers
 - Custom allocator for chunks (both DRAM and VRAM)
 - More Blocks
 - Biomes - either perlin or worley noise
 - Seperate water shader
 - Fake water physics?
 - Better structure generation
